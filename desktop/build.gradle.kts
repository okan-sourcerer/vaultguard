// A desktop client for the same vault. It exists first of all as proof that :core really
// is portable — if the Argon2id configuration or the UTF-16BE password encoding differed
// by one byte here, a backup written by the phone would not open.
//
// It deliberately reads and writes the v2 backup file rather than talking to Firestore.
// That keeps it offline and reversible while the foundation is being proven; the sync
// client is the next step, not this one.

// Newer than :core's Java 11, which exists to match what Android can dex. Nothing here
// is dexed, and java.net.http (the only HTTP client used) wants 11 or later anyway.
